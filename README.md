# wa-cleanup
## A simple Termux script that deletes WhatsApp sent media.

I wrote this little script in Termux (Android terminal app) because I was tired of WhatsApp saving light copies of sent media and having to remove them by hand.

Target folder is /sdcard/WhatsApp/Media/WhatsApp type_of_media/Sent , where WhatsApp actually keeps a copy of all media you've sent even if you deleted them from your gallery.
